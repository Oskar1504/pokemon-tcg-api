# Pokemon tcg Api

this is a small tool which lets you host your own Pokemon tcg api.

It scraps data from https://limitlesstcg.com and parse it into .json files.

Ones the Data scraped the expressJS api delivers the .json files.

### WIP
- You can specify after how much seconds/houers the data files gets invalidated and needs to be scraped again. This is only usefull if u need the prices for the cards.
- you can specify the language in ``.env``

## Howto
- specify sets to be scraped in ``/server/data/setcodes.json``
- run `npm run scrap`
    - this will scrap an copy all the data from limitlesstcg.com
    - you can also reduce the delay between each request to speed up the process
        - be carefull you can mybe get softbanned from the website when delay to short
- specify/edit ``.env`` file to your needs
- after the script finished run `npm run start`
